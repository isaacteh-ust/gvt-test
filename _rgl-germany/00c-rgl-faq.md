#### 25.	What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app? 

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data. 

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found [here](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg). 

#### 26.	What is SafeEntry? 

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the identification numbers and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

An existing check-in method is via scanning of a QR code at the venue with a camera phone or a QR scanner app. Hence, you are encouraged to purchase a Singapore local data SIM card, or connect your mobile phone to a Singapore local Wi-Fi network to access the form for this mode of check-in. 
 
Alternatively, some venues allow you to complete SafeEntry by presenting your passport as identification. Establishments will assist visitors with manual SafeEntry check-in.

More information can be found at <https://www.safeentry.gov.sg>.

As Singapore is currently listed as a non-risk area<sup>5</sup> by the relevant German authorities, travellers who have been to Singapore for the past 14 days and are eligible to enter Germany need not be quarantined or subjected to a COVID-19 test upon entering Germany.
