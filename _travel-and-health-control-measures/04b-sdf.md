### SHN-Dedicated Facilities (SDF)

To limit the spread of COVID-19, several hotels in Singapore have been designated as SHN-Dedicated Facilities (SDF). In general, travellers issued with a 14-day SHN are required to complete their SHN at an SDF. Eligible travellers must apply three working days before their scheduled arrival in Singapore, to opt-out of SDF if they meet the following conditions:

Any prior approvals for opt-out granted may be revoked due to the latest public health risk assessment. In such an event, the prevailing border and health control measures will apply. This includes SDF stays and payments, where applicable. As of 30 December 2020, the cost of SDF stay, inclusive of GST, is about $2,000, not including [charges for COVID-19 tests](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price). The actual amount, however, will be conveyed and charged to the traveller during check-in. Travellers who fail to pay for their SDF can expect to be charged for late payments.
