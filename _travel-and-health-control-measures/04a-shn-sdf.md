### Overview 

SHNs are legal notices issued under Singapore’s Infectious Diseases Act, to require a person to remain at their place of residence or Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility ([SDF](/health/shn/sdf)) at all times for a stipulated period. Any breach in the SHN requirements is punishable under Singapore laws, which can amount to an imprisonment term and/or fine. Additional punitive measures such as the cancellation of long term visit passes could also be taken by the relevant authorities.

Depending on the travellers’ travel history and safe travel lane used to enter Singapore, travellers may be issued with a 7 or 14-day SHN with a mandatory [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) conducted towards the end of the SHN.

Requirements for SHN or COVID-19 PCR tests are specific to individual [Safe Travel Lanes](/arriving/overview). Travellers should note that the SHN comes into effect <u>immediately</u> on the day of its issuance. The SHN will end at 12 pm, 7 or 14 days <u>after</u> arrival. See examples below:

### SHN Compliance Checks

Travellers issued with the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) will be subjected to on-site or electronic compliance checks (SMS, phone/video calls) from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Ministry of Education (MOE). Travellers should note that officers conducting house visits will produce their warrant cards or authorisation letters as proof of identity. For phone/video compliance checks, travellers will only be asked to provide the last four digits of his/her Identity Card or Travel Document for verification. <u>Any payment request made by the caller may be a scam</u>. Travellers may call 6812 5555 for further enquiries or assistance.

Travellers serving their SHN outside of SDFs will also be issued with electronic SHN monitoring devices and more information on these devices can be found [here](/health/shn-monitoring).
