The SafeTravel Pass is a mandatory document for inbound travellers from approved countries/regions seeking to make essential business and official travel to Singapore under Green/ Fast Lane arrangements.

On 28 May 2020, Singapore and China agreed to create a Fast Lane to facilitate essential business and official travel between both countries. The Fast Lane arrangement will be first applied between Singapore and six Chinese provinces and municipalities (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang). The SafeTravel Pass may be used for essential business and official travel to Singapore via the Singapore-China Fast Lane.

### **Application**

Business or official travellers seeking to make essential travel via the Fast Lane to Singapore from the above-mentioned six Chinese provinces and municipalities must be sponsored<sup>1</sup> by either a Singapore-based company or a Singapore Government agency, which will file an application on behalf of the traveller for a SafeTravel pass.

IMPORTANT

Travellers (who are not Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents or Long-Term Pass holders) without a valid SafeTravel Pass will be refused entry into Singapore.

## **Process Overview**

### **Before entering Singapore**

#### Visa Requirements

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the applicant, as well as the sponsoring company or government agency.

With the SafeTravel Pass approval, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder can proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels.  If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa.  The applicant can check his/her visa status through [this page](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save).

**Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for Green/ Fast Lane travel.** Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to electronically submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations and declare his/her accommodation in Singapore via the [SG Arrival Card](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/), before departing for Singapore. The SG Arrival Card can also be accessed via the [Visit Singapore Travel Guide App](https://www.visitsingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/visit-singapore-travel-guide-app/).

#### Pre-Departure Measures

Prior to travelling to Singapore, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers are required to:
- Monitor their health status and defer travel if feeling unwell;
- Have not travelled out of China in the entirety of the 7 days prior to departure. 
- Take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure and obtain a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19. The SafeTravel Pass applicant will bear the cost of the pre-departure PCR test.

Travellers are also strongly encouraged to [register and pre-pay](https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/) for their post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test prior to departing for Singapore. 

In the event that the visitor is unable to payment before departing to Singapore, please ensure that he/she has a mobile phone with an activated line upon arrival, as on-site payment would typically require an OTP being sent to the phone.

At pre-boarding checks, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers must produce:
  - A valid SafeTravel Pass for the intended week of travel,
  - A valid visa (for visa-required passport holders),
  - A negative COVID-19 PCR test result,
  - A return air ticket.

Otherwise, the traveller can be refused boarding.

### **Arrival and Stay in Singapore**

#### Post-Arrival Measures

The SafeTravel Pass traveller will undergo and bear the costs of a COVID-19 **PCR test** upon arrival in Singapore.

At arrival immigration, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers should declare he/she is a SafeTravel Pass holder, and must produce:
- A valid SafeTravel Pass for the intended week of travel,
- A valid visa (for visa-required passport holders),
- A negative COVID-19 PCR test result,
- A return air ticket.

Approved travellers without these documents will be refused entry into Singapore under the RGL arrangement.

The host<sup>2</sup> company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the airport to the declared self-sourced accommodation, adhering to prevailing health measures. The applicant must remain in the declared accommodation (non-residential address only) until the test result is released.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the traveller can proceed on the pre-declared controlled itinerary. If tested positive for COVID-19, the traveller will undergo medical treatment at his/her cost.

#### Measures during stay in Singapore

SafeTravel Pass travellers to Singapore are required to download and use the **TraceTogether** app for the duration of their stay. If a traveller does not have a TraceTogether-compatible device, the host company or government agency shall provide one to the traveller.

In addition to abiding by prevailing local public health and safety distancing measures, SafeTravel Pass travellers must adhere to a **controlled itinerary** that is supervised by the host company or government agency for the first 14 days. The traveller is prohibited from using public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.
