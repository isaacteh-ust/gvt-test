All travellers are required to comply with the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19" target="_blank"> prevailing public health regulations and requirements</a> in Singapore. For example, the use of the mandatory mobile application (e.g. TraceTogether), as well as serving Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and taking the COVID-19 test (if required).

A summary of the prevailing SHN and swab requirements for travellers can be found <a href="/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

### 1. Stay-Home Notice (SHN) - If Applicable

Depending on the traveller’s scheme of travel, they may be issued with a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) when entering Singapore. Click <a href="https://service2.mom.gov.sg/shn/shn-calculator/" target="_blank">here</a> to calculate the last day of your SHN.

Watch the video below on the SHN requirements and <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/advisories/moh-health-advisory-for-persons-issued-stay-home-notice_4-nov.pdf" target="_blank">read the requirements for persons placed on SHN</a>.

**SHN Enforcement**

ICA will conduct checks on travellers placed on SHN. These entails house visits, calls or WhatsApp. During the call, a traveller will be asked for the last four digits of his/her Identity Card/ travel document to ascertain his/her identity. Officers conducting house visits will produce their warrant cards or ICA authorisation letter as a proof of their identity.

Travellers who fail to comply with the SHN requirements can be reported to ICA via <a href="https://go.gov.sg/reportshnbreach" target="_blank">this form</a> or 6812 5555. Errant travellers prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act and its regulations, can be fined up to $10,000, and/or imprisoned for up to six months. Additional penalties such as the revocation of the immigration or work passes can also be imposed.

**SHN Helpline**

For SHN-related enquiries or assistance, travellers can contact the SHN Helpline at <u>6812 5555</u>.


### 2. Dedicated SHN Facility - If Applicable

#### Stay at SHN Dedicated Facility 
 
Please refer to the following link for common questions on the SHN facilities: [here](https://www.gov.sg/article/questions-about-the-dedicated-shn-facilities-for-returnees-answered)

From 1 January 2021 onwards, costs of stay at dedicated SHN facilities for SCs and PRs who last left Singapore before 27 March will no longer be waived. Please refer to the following link for details: [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-to-stay-home-notice-and-charging-policy-for-travellers)

Any payment required will be communicated by the SHN facilities during the stay and travellers are required to pay the charges upfront when checking into the SHN facility. Failure to do so may result in late payment interests being charged.

#### Opt out of Stay-Home Notice (SHN) Dedicated Facility for selected countries/regions

Travellers from the list of [countries/regions](/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf) (as indicated in S/N 3 of the table) may opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:

- Travelled to no other country/region/place than the above mentioned countries/regions/places, in the last consecutive 14 days prior to departure for Singapore;
- Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members with the same travel history, who are also serving their SHN of the same duration and period; and
- There is no one ordinarily residing at the place of residence (e.g. domestic helper) who does not share the same travel history, and the traveller has already made all necessary arrangements to ensure that any such person will not reside at the place of residence until the conclusion of the SHN period.

Applications must be made at least three days prior to arrival in Singapore. Applications can be submitted [here](/sc-pr/opt-out/apply-now) for Singapore citizens (SC) and permanent residents (PRs). Non SCs or PRs may apply to opt out as part of the entry approval process

The list of countries/regions eligible for opt-out of dedicated SHN facilities will be updated from time to time depending on the public health risk assessment. Travellers must be prepared that any prior approvals given for opt-out from dedicated SHN facilities may be revoked, and the prevailing border measures upon entry will apply, including stay in SHN dedicated facility and payment, where applicable.

#### Travellers with extenuating circumstances serving SHN at Dedicated Facility 

Travellers who are unable to serve their SHN at a dedicated SHN facility (SDF) due to extenuating circumstances (e.g. serious medical conditions or mobility issues) can use this [form](https://go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds) for further information and assistance.

### 3. SHN Electronic Monitoring Device

Eligible travellers will be issued an electronic monitoring device at the immigration checkpoints by ICA or MOM. These devices must be activated immediately by the traveller upon reaching his/her SHN accommodation. Click here for the <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/covid-19/stayhomesg-user-setup-guide.pdf" target="_blank">User Setup Guide</a> and [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/covid-19/stay@homesg-faqs.pdf). Travellers who are 12 years old and below will not receive the electronic monitoring device.

Information on the device can be found in the video and infographic below.

**Return and Disposal of Electronic Monitoring Devices After SHN**

Upon completion of SHN, travellers are to remove the electronic wristband and dispose of it based on <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/e-waste-management/where-to-recycle-e-waste" target="_blank">existing e-waste disposal methods</a>.

ICA officers will contact the traveller to collect the gateway device issued by ICA. Please <u>do not dispose the gateway device</u>.

### 4. Post-Arrival COVID-19 PCR Test
Depending on the traveller’s scheme of travel, he/she may be required to take the COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore, or before the completion of his/her SHN. In general, children aged 6 and below (based on year of birth) do not need to take the COVID-19 PCR swab test, unless their close contacts are found to be COVID-19 positive.

Travellers serving their SHN will receive the details of their test appointments at their registered mobile numbers. The swab results will be conveyed within 1 to 4 days. All travellers, including those tested on arrival, must remain in self-isolation until a negative COVID-19 test result is conveyed.

Estimated PCR test costs can be found in the table below:
