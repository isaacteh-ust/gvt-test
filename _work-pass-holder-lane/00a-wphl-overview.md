### Overview and Application

All pass holders (work pass holders and dependents) must obtain entry approvals from the relevant government agencies to enter Singapore. Singapore Work Pass Holders and their dependants must obtain [MOM’s entry approval](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-to-bring-pass-holders-into-singapore) to enter Singapore.

However, those conveying essential services or supplies (E.g. lorry drivers or vegetable supply truckers) coming from Malaysia by land or sea crossing are exempted from the entry approval requirement.

For: 
- **Existing work pass holders who are Malaysians or Malaysia permanent residents and entering Singapore by land**, employers can sponsor their entry under the [Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA)](/pca/overview).
- **All other pass holders, including those on In-Principle Approval, Dependant's Pass, MOM-issued Long Term Visit Pass and Letter of Consent**, must continue to obtain <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-to-bring-pass-holders-into-singapore" target="_blank"> MOM's entry approval</a> to enter Singapore, except for those who have an approval under the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL).

### Travelling from Hong Kong under the Air Travel Bubble (ATB) Arrangement

#### IMPORTANT NOTICE: DEFERMENT OF SINGAPORE – HONG KONG AIR TRAVEL BUBBLE (ATB) FLIGHTS LAUNCH

Given the evolving COVID-19 situation in Hong Kong, the Singapore and Hong Kong Governments have agreed to defer the launch of the Singapore – Hong Kong Air Travel Bubble (ATB) flights. This is to safeguard public health in both cities as well as travellers’ health.

Pass holders can still travel from Hong Kong to Singapore on non-designated ATB flights and will be subject to the prevailing health measures upon entry into Singapore. In addition, pass holders must obtain MOM’s entry approval to enter Singapore.
