### 1. Eligibility 

<span class="font-size:16px;">Foreigners who are short-term visitors travelling from Hong Kong under the Air Travel Bubble (ATB) arrangement may seek entry into Singapore by applying for an Air Travel Pass (ATP).</span>
            
<span class="font-size:16px;">Singapore Citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents, and Singapore Long-Term Pass holders are not required to apply for an ATP to travel to Singapore. However, Singapore Long-Term Pass holders will still have to seek entry approval from the relevant Singapore Government agencies, which issued their Long-Term Pass, before travelling to Singapore. Please refer <a href="/health">here</a> for the prevailing health measures applicable upon entry into Singapore.</span>

Visitors who do not meet the Air Travel Pass conditions may be refused entry into Singapore and/or have their Air Travel Pass cancelled. In such an event, visitors may also be liable for the cost of their repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation. In addition, their future Air Travel Pass applications may also be rejected. <br/><br/>
