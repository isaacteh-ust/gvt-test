The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a Safe Travel Lane agreed between the Governments of Singapore and Malaysia. It supports companies in Singapore and Malaysia by facilitating the movement of workers between both countries. Companies that need to bring their employees into Malaysia or Singapore can sponsor an application.

Under the PCA, approved travellers/employees are required to remain in their country of employment for at least 90 days before returning to their home country for short-term home leave. Cross-border entry under the PCA is only permitted via land at the Causeway and Second link. Upon entry into Singapore, PCA-approved travellers/employees are required to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) before taking a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test.
