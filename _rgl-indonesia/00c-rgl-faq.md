## **Application Process for Travellers in Indonesia**

### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Singapore under the RGL? 

Indonesian Citizens who need to make single-entry, short-term essential travel from Indonesia to Singapore for business or official purposes. 

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder who is resident in Indonesia. Am I eligible to apply for the RGL to travel from Indonesia to Singapore? 

Under the RGL, only Indonesian Citizens who need to make essential business or official travel are allowed to travel from Indonesia to Singapore. These would include Indonesian citizens who are also Singapore Permanent Residents or Singapore Long-Term Pass holders.  

#### 3. What is a SafeTravel Pass?

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.
 
Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass

#### 4. How do applicants in Indonesia apply to travel to Singapore under the RGL? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a SafeTravel Pass? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit? 

Applicants in Indonesia seeking to travel to Singapore for essential business or official travel via the RGL must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup> 

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 2 to 5 weeks before the week of traveller's planned departure. 

The processing of the application can take up to 7 working days (excluding the day of application). 

You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test before departure for Singapore.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company / government agency by email. Singapore’s visa-free entry policies prior to COVID-19 will apply for Indonesian Citizens travelling under the RGL.     
 
The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the [SG Arrival Card](https://eservices.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/), within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore. 
 
Prior to the traveller’s departure from Indonesia, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s certificate of negative result for COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure and latest controlled itinerary in Singapore at <http://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>, for applications for entry into Singapore from 9 Nov 2020 onwards.
 
The traveller is required to present his/her valid SafeTravel Pass, certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test (in English), a  valid return air/ferry ticket or proof of other transport arrangements to depart from Singapore for pre-boarding checks at the airlines/ferries check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding. Ferry passengers with symptoms, i.e. febrile or visual signs of acute respiratory infection, will be turned back on the next ferry trip upon detection at the ferry terminal in Singapore.

#### 5. What are the responsibilities of the host company? 

When a company applies for the SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller, it is also responsible for the timely submission of the accompanying documents. 
 
The host company should also ensure that the traveller abides by the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Indonesia RGL, and the prevailing health measures during his/her stay in Singapore. Authorities may ask for proof of adherence to the controlled itinerary, including physical verification or SafeEntry Pass records (e.g. screenshots), and other terms and conditions when the traveller is in Singapore.  
 
You can access the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Indonesia RGL [here](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/indonesia/rgl/terms-and-conditions). Action will be taken against the traveller and the host company in the event of non-compliance. 

#### 6. Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes? 

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists. 
 
#### 7. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner? 

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 8. Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass? 

No payment is required. 

#### 9. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass? 

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application. 
 
If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application. One traveller can only hold one valid SafeTravel Pass for a single entry into Singapore at any one point in time. Please refrain from submitting multiple SafeTravel Pass applications or submitting new applications when you already have a valid SafeTravel Pass on hand. Duplicate applications will be rejected. 

#### 10.  What happens if I do not comply with the terms and conditions for the SafeTravel Pass?

#### 11. What is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore? 

A traveller using the RGL scheme may stay for up to 10 days in Singapore.

Both the SafeTravel Pass application and issued SafeTravel Pass cannot be amended. Please ensure that all details of the application form are accurate at the point of submission.

#### 13.  What can I do if I have changes to my controlled itinerary? 

The host company or government agency should be responsible for monitoring and reporting any deviation in your controlled itinerary. The host company or government agency should email the updated controlled itinerary on behalf of the traveller to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg>.

#### 27. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore? 

RGL travellers from Indonesia must take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore at the airport or ferry terminal, and remain isolated in a declared selfsourced, non-residential accommodation until negative test results are released (typically within 48 hours). Transportation from the airport or ferry terminal to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the travellers’ host, subject to prevailing health measures.<sup>2</sup> Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival COVID19 PCR test(s) in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation. 
 
If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.<sup>3</sup> 

Throughout the duration of the traveller’s controlled itinerary, he/she is not allowed access to common facilities or amenities in the declared accommodation, that are not within the ambit of activities related to the conduct of business activities. Such examples include gyms, swimming pools, sauna facilities or any other recreational places.
 
Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup>4</sup>, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore. If the traveller subsequently tests positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore, he/she will be required to upload his/her TraceTogether app data via the TraceTogether app, using an upload code provided by MOH. If the traveller had used the TraceTogether app on a phone that was provided by the host/sponsor, the host/sponsor will be required to upload the TraceTogether app data via the same process. 
 
Travellers should also abide by the prevailing public health measures in Singapore. 

#### 28. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app? 
 
The TraceTogether app supports Singapore’s nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data. 
 
The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above, as well as phones with iOS version 10 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg>. 
 
#### 29. What is SafeEntry?
 
SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the personal identification numbers and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters. 

An existing check-in method is via scanning of a QR code at the venue with a camera phone or a QR scanner app. Hence, you are encouraged to purchase a Singapore local data SIM card, or connect your mobile phone to a Singapore local Wi-Fi network to access the form for this mode of check-in. 
 
Alternatively, some venues allow you to complete SafeEntry by presenting your passport as identification. Establishments will assist visitors with manual SafeEntry check-in.
